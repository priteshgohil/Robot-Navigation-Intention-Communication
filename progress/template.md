   * Last week, I was working on the message framework and updated the same in github issue.
   * Following week, my plan is to work on parsing message received on serial port and execute a command based on the request.
   * No this week I don't see anything that can prevent mer to achieve my sprint goal.

   * What did I do last week?
   * What will I do in the following week?
   * Do I have any problems which will prevent me from reaching our sprint goal? If yes, what?
