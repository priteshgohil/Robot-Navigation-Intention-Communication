Priteshkumar Gohil:

   * Last week, I was working on the message framework and updated the same in github issue.
   * Following week, my plan is to work on parsing message received on serial port and execute a command based on the request.
   * No this week I don't see anything that can prevent mer to achieve my sprint goal.

Eduardo Cervantes:

   * Last week I was learning the basic commands used by Adafruit CircuitPlayground to interact with the internal components (NeoLeds,  Buzer, Buttons, Accelerometer, etc.). Additionally, I developed an initial sketch of basic communication between our board and Python.
   
   * Going from simple parsing to implement a more robust method into our board
    
   * Until now, I haven't detect any possible problem.
